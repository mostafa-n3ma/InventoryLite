# Inventory Lite

#### Video Demo: <URL HERE>

#### Description:

As a beginner, there are main packages to describe in an Android app, which is `(app)`. The other packages are either for managing dependencies and arranging them, such as the `Gradle` package, or self-generated files such as `Idea`, etc.

Starting to describe the `app` package:

The app code core is in the `src` package and it contains three packages:

1. `main`: Main code core and the UI layouts.
2. `android testing`: For applying Android testing operations.
3. `unit testing`: For writing unit testing.

As for now, I didn't have the time to do any testing classes, and I want to catch up with the course to submit before it ends this year. I will start in the `main` package, which is all the code I wrote:

### Main:

Contains two packages:

1. `java`: Logic code written with Kotlin.
2. `res`: XML layouts describing the screens layouts that are connected to the classes such as activities, fragments, and adapters.

#### Java Package:

In package `com.mostafan3ma.android.barcode11`, there are two packages:

1.1. `operations`.
1.2. `presentation`.
1.3. `InventoryLiteApp.kt` class: I am using Hilt Dagger for dependency injection, and it requires an Application Class to hold all the Dagger components and start with it as the base class.
1.4. `MainActivity.kt` class: The main screen which will carry different fragments will pop in and pop out on the `MainActivity` layout.


1.1 operations description: 
contains the following :-
                        1.1.1 - data_Entities : which includes all the the entities that the app deals with I separate the entities types for Local& Remote % Domain 
                                Local for saving them into database 
                                Remote : fro sending and retrieving them from a remote server ( I didn't implement that yet but planning to do so after submitting the project )
                                Domain : the entity that will be handled by screens and viewModels basely the any logic don't deal with database directly
                                the reason I did that is for in case something wrong happened in one of the dataSources it will not effect the UI data 
                                and I also provided a mapper Class to map from and into the entities
                        1.1.2 - data_Management : which contains the logic for the local and remote data sources and also a repository class to manage both data sources in one place 
                                sub files are :
                               - data_Management.LocalDataSource.RoomDatabase : which contains the shopDao and shopDatabase to generate and database instance and provide controlling function to manage that database
                                 RoomDataBase is really helpful library 
                                 I only need to provide the database name and the required context and the cacheEntities I want to create tables of and it just do the rest
                                 and in the Dao it's an interface annotated with @DAO annotation add  the function with no body's that  I want to operate  on my database some queries and SQLITE commands  
                               - data_Management.LocalDataSource.DefaultLocalDataSource : an interface for the default localDataBase class I made this just to clear the function first that I want to use on the data Source 
                                 then I can extend this interface to the real class of the LocalDataSource 
                                 the reason I did that is for testing reasons so I can create demo dataSource and injected it to the repository later and test the repository ANd since the database cant be 
                                 tested without android classes and libraries so I plan to do fake DataSource that will implement the same DefaultLocalDataSource interface
                               - data_Management.localDatabaseSource.LocalDatabaseSource  the real DataSource that will deal with the database and handle the entities transformation form and into the database
                               - data_Management.repository.DefaultShopRepository : Interface of the repository again for testing reasons so I can make fake repository and inject it where I need
                               - operations.data_Management.repository.ShopRepository: one place that controls the operations of both the local and remote sources complaining functions from all different dataSources
                                  also I am injecting the localDataSource and mapper Classes to it
                        1.1.3 - di : contains the dagger modules that will be injected in many places 
                                     here I have two modules for the repository and for the database 
                                     this helps the dagger to know how to provide complicated classes instances for injection
                        1.1.4 - utils : all kind of classes and methods that would help me get some quick results and shorten the code for me in any class I need it 
                                        - BindingAdapters : contains all the binding adapters that  used to bind views in tow way dataBinding and also to get the image from internal storage and display it in a ImageView 
                                        - DataState : simple Sealed Class helps me to detect result data states such as error , success , Loading a quick way to handle different results when fetching data 
                                        - HideKeyBoard : extended method to use in fragments or activities useful for hiding the keyBoard quickly
                                        - Mapper : mapper interface to be extended in all mappers classes 
                                        - beep : contains the class BeepPlayer to play the beep sound when detecting barcode results on the camera surface
                                        - permissionChecker : just an extended function to check permissions and get their result in a fragment using the new
                                          registering way and result Launcher instead of the old onRequestPermissionsResult fun that is deprecated
                                        - simpleUtils : contains simple function to get the currentDate and getting unique receipt_id
                                        - SuperImageController : A simple class I wrote previously to deal with images
                                          Its functions are:
                                                        - Display the photo selection window from the gallery
                                                        - Give the resulting image that was returned with the selection window closed
                                                        - Save images to the deviceâ€™s internal storage and within the program files to save them locally and save them under a specific name
                                                        - Retrieve images with a specific name from the internal storage
                                                        - Delete an image with a specific name from the internal storage

1.2 presentation description : 
contains as follows:- 
                    1.2.1:Adapters: which contains the listAdapters that wil control and descripe the items in the recyclerViews their are many adapters classes but I will give some short description for each one of them and the special things of it 
                          - InventoriesAdapter: like any adapter it has ViewHolder ,DiffUtil and I create a class called InventoriesListener which I used like
                                                a click Listener will send some data information whine the single item clicked 
                                                the viewHolder have a variable passed to it with binding like every other viewHolder
                                                but this viewHolder I create for it an expend animation for the main card triggered when 
                                                clicking the item and calling the fun  checkCardExpendableStatus() view in the layout
                                                and back to the listener variable it passing back with the Adapter Constructor information of
                                                the clicked item view so I can make some action from the fragment or pass it to the viewModel to handle it.
                          - ReceiptAdapter: the special thing about this adapter that it's listener return back information about the clicked
                                            item like id ,position and the operator which tells the viewModel that the plus or the minus button have been clicked
                          - AnalyticsAdapter : this Adapter have four types resampled by the letters:
                                               _Q : to show the quantities of the inventories in the Analytics screen take items from the type Domain_Transaction
                                                   I just wrote a condition in the bind() function that will turn the item background to red if the quantity is then 10
                                               _S : to show the inventories sales in the Analytics screen it has condition that turns the item background to gold when the
                                                   sales is more then 1000$ as a sign of good sales (take items in the type of Domain_Transaction)
                                               _E : to show the expiry dates of inventories in the Analytics screen it takes items in the type Domain_Inventory and has a condition
                                                   if the expiry date is near to expire turns the item background to red and I am using the fun  isNearToBeExpired() that returning true if the expiry date is near to expire 
                                               _R : to show both sales & purchases receipts in the analytics screen and also have expendable card animation like _Q adapter 
                                                   showing the receipt information like the receipt id ,date,items list and the total amount 
                    1.2.2:Fragments : the classes that controls the screens of the app 
                                      - DashboardFragment : simple fragment that display the main dashboard screen with the buttons that navigate to the other screens 
                                                            the viewModel is injected to it directly and the layout is inflated by binding variable
                                                            viewModel is passed to the layout by the viewBinding principle with the viewLifeCycle to match the view context with the fragment context 
                                                            the fragment controls only the views and do not make any logic it's only listens to the viewModels events and make actions on the views such as click events and navigation directions 
                                                            the fun subscribeObservers() is where the liveData observed from the viewModel 
                                      - InventoriesFragment : this fragment displays the inventories screen 
                                                              a variable of superImageController is injected to it in the constructor 
                                                              the viewModel also injected directly 
                                                              inventoriesAdapter is declared latent and will be initiated in the onCreateView()
                                                              binding is inflated and passing the viewModel instance to it along with the adapter instance 
                                                              permissionRequest is declared as ActivityResultLauncher<Array<String>> to be used latter in the getPermissions fun 
                                                              cameraSource & detector is declared to be used in opening camera and detecting barcodes used in  setUpBarcodeDetector()
                                                              functions : 
                                                              - onCreateView(): this is one of the super class Fragment functions represents one of the fragment lifecycle status it will be overwritten and it's called when creating the main layout view
                                                                                  like I sade profusely inflating the binding layout by layoutInflater and passing the viewModel instance setting the lifecycleOwner on from the fragment 
                                                                                  initiating the inventoriesAdapter and detecting the listeners returning data it has two listener ( clickListener & longClickListener) both returning the clicked item id and position 
                                                                                  the clickListener have no use right now but in the longListener I am triggering a viewModel event to opened the bottomSheet with the clickedItem data that will be observed in fragment
                                                                                  but getting the actual data from the viewModel 
                                                                                  then passing the adapter instance to the binding layout 
                                                                                  initiating the beepPlayer instance to used later to play beep when detecting barcodes
                                                                                  launching the permissions request by initiating the permissionRequest instance 
                                                                                  calling subscribeObservers() that will listen to the viewModel event and live data and preform actions according to their values 
                                                                                  and last thing onCreateView must return the layout view that wil be created in this fragment will be the inventories layout and since I am using the binding instance I will return binding.root 
                                                              - setUpBottomSheet() : just fun to initiate the bottomSheetBehavior inflating it from the bottomSheet layout and setting it's draggable to false so it's not gona close when dragging it down only 
                                                                                     when the viewModel event CloseBottomSheet is triggered
                                                              - onDestroy() : this also is one of the super class Fragment functions represents one of the fragment lifecycle status it will be overwritten
                                                                              this function called when destroying the fragment layout and popping the fragment out from the stack 
                                                                              I used it to release the beepPlayer instance to release the mediaPlayer resources and avoid memory leaks
                                                              - getPermissionsRequest() : to check the permissions if is granted or not 
                                                                                          in this fragment we need the Camera permission to open and use the device camera for detecting barcodes 
                                                                                          in this fun I called the function registerForActivityResult which is from the super class Fragment it's new method instead of onRequestPermissionsResult() which is deprecated  
                                                                                          the idea is to check the permission every time the user clicks the barcode button and request to use the camera for detecting the barcode so if the permission is granted setUp 
                                                                                          the barcode detector and expend the barcode card/ if not granted announce a toast message to the user to grant the permission if he want to use the camera
                                                              - checkBarcodeScannerCard() : this fun called when viewModel event is triggered when the button is clicked it simply check the cardView if not expended then play the animation 
                                                                                            and expend the card by converting the card layout visibility to vbe visible the opposite when its expended collapse the card View by turning the visibility back to gone and play the animation 
                                                              - setUpBarcodeDetector() : I collected the in which initiating the surfaceCallBack and the detector possessor in one place 
                                                                                         setting the surfaceCallBack will intuit the camera surface and open the camera in the cardView
                                                                                         initiating the possessor will connect a barCode detecting possessor to possess the images coming from the camera and determine if it valid barcode or not  
                                                                                         this will be explained in the InventoriesViewModel class as it part of the events flow 
                                                              - setUpCategoriesChips(categoriesList) : when fetching the Inventories List from the database and filtering the categories list as liveData in the InventoriesViewModel

                                                               * also I am using liveData isolation Like the variable _clickInventoriesCard which is MutableLiveData<Boolean>() and a regular liveData<Boolean>  in the variable 
                                                                 clickInventoriesCard how will receive it value from the MutableLiveData version this will give me kind of safety so that the live data cannot be changed outside
                                                                 the viewModel and the copy version will be for observing only

                                                                         Initialization:-

                                                                                                    repository.get_Inventories() is a suspend fun from the repository ,Suspending functions are used for asynchronous
                                                                                                    operations , such as querying databases. The use of suspend allows the functions to be called from a coroutine without

                                                                                                    some action for each emitted item in the Flow. In this case, it's used to observe the data emitted by the repository's suspended functions.
                                                                                                    Handling Different DataStates: Inside the onEach block, you handle different DataState objects that are emitted by the repository function:
                                                                                                    DataState.Error: If there's an error during data retrieval, you log the error message, which can be useful for debugging and error reporting.
                                                                                                    DataState.Loading: You log a message indicating that data is currently loading. This can be helpful to provide feedback to the user or for debugging purposes.
                                                                                                    DataState.Success: If data retrieval is successful, you extract the data from the DataState object and perform the necessary processing. For example,
                                                                                                                       in updateSoldOutProduct(), you check if any of the products are sold out, and in updateTodaySales(), you calculate today's sales.
                                                                                                    By using viewModelScope.launch and onEach, I ensure that these data retrieval operations are performed asynchronously in the background, which prevents them from 
                                                                                                    blocking the main thread and keeps the app responsive. Additionally, the use of Kotlin Flow and DataState allows for handling various scenarios, including errors 
                                                                                                    and loading states, in a structured and clean way.
                                                                          - updateTodaySales(): This function calculates today's sales by retrieving a list of transactions and summing up the transaction amounts for sales made today. 
                                                                                                it uses the same principal as updateSoldOutProduct()
                                                                          - setDashBoardEvent(event: DashboardViewModelEvents): This function handles click events and updates the corresponding LiveData objects.

                                                          - Data Initialization:
                                                                                The ViewModel initializes various properties, LiveData objects, and lists.
                                                                                It also fetches data from the ShopRepository during initialization, populating inventories and namesSuggestions LiveData objects.
                                                          - Business Logic and Data Management:
                                                                                                It manages a list of product inventories (inventories) and a list of items in the current receipt (_receiptList).
                                                                                                It provides functions to update the receipt list, calculate the total receipt amount, and manage individual product quantities in the receipt.
                                                                                                The done function finalizes a purchase transaction by updating inventories and recording a transaction.
                                                          - Coroutine Usage:
                                                                            The ViewModel uses Kotlin Coroutines for handling asynchronous operations, including data fetching and processing.
                                                          - Sealed Classes for Event Types:
                                                                                           It uses sealed classes (SellViewModelEvent) to categorize different types of UI events and handle them accordingly. Events trigger specific behaviors in the ViewModel.                           
                                                          - Enumeration Types:
                                                                              The ViewModel defines an enumeration type (InputType) for distinguishing between different types of user inputs (text and barcode).
                                                          the SellViewModel class follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture commonly used in Android app development. It effectively manages the state and business
                                                          logic for selling products, handling various UI interactions and events,and uses LiveData and Coroutines for reactive programming and asynchronous operations.
                                        - AnalyticsViewModel : responsible for displaying analytics and insights related to product inventory and transactions. Here's an overview of its key components and functionality:
                                                              - Constructor and Dependency Injection:
                                                                The ViewModel is injected with a dependency, the ShopRepository, which is used for data management. This follows the dependency injection pattern.
                                                              - LiveData for Data Observation:
                                                                                              It uses LiveData objects to store and observe various data, including total expenses (totalExpenses), total profit (totalProfit),
                                                                                              and various flags to track UI events (e.g., backBtnClicked, quantitiesCardClicked, etc.).
                                                              - Event Handling:
                                                                               It handles various UI events using the setEvent function, such as clicking different cards and buttons to trigger specific UI actions.
                                                              - Data Initialization:
                                                                                    The ViewModel initializes LiveData objects, flags, and some properties.It initiates the fetching of data through the fetchData function.
                                                              - Data Fetching and Processing:
                                                                                             It uses Kotlin Coroutines to fetch data asynchronously from the ShopRepository.
                                                                                             The ViewModel fetches and processes two types of data: product inventories and transaction records.
                                                              - Update Total Expenses and Profit:
                                                                                                 It calculates the total expenses and profit based on the transaction records. Expenses are calculated
                                                                                                 from "PURCHASE" transactions, while profit is calculated from "SELL" transactions.
                                                              - Generate Receipt Lists:
                                                                                       It generates lists of receipts by grouping transactions based on transaction type ("SELL" or "PURCHASE"). The transactions within a receipt
                                                                                       are grouped together into ReceiptItem objects.
                                                              - Sort and Filter Data:
                                                                                     It sorts and filters the data to generate various insights, such as the list of products by quantities (quantitiesList), sales records (salesList),
                                                                                     and expiring products (expiryList).
                                                              - Sealed Classes for Event Types:
                                                                                               It uses sealed classes (AnalyticsEvent) to categorize different types of UI events and handle them accordingly. These events trigger specific
                                                                                               behaviors in the ViewModel.
                                                              - Enumeration Types:
                                                                                  The ViewModel defines an enumeration type (TRANSACTION_TYPE) for distinguishing between different types of transactions (SELL and PURCHASE).
                                                              the AnalyticsViewModel class follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture commonly used in Android app development. It effectively manages data related to product inventories
                                                              and transactions, handles various UI interactions, and uses LiveData and Coroutines for reactive programming and asynchronous data fetching. It also calculates and presents insights 
                                                              related to expenses, profit, product quantities, sales records, and expiring products.
                    1.2.4:FragmentFactory:
                                          used to create and instantiate fragments dynamically. Here's a summary of the key components and functionality of this FragmentFactory:
                                          - Constructor and Dependency Injection:
                                                                                 The FragmentFactory is injected with dependencies, including a ShopRepository and a SuperImageController. These dependencies are provided for use 
                                                                                 within the fragments.
                                          - Fragment Instantiation:
                                                                   The FragmentFactory overrides the instantiate method. This method is called by the Android framework to create instances of fragments based on their class names
                                                                   (class names as strings).
                                          - Fragment Mapping:
                                                             Inside the instantiate method, there is a when expression that maps class names to the corresponding fragment types and creates instances of those fragments.
                                          - Fragment Types:
                                                           The following fragment types are created:
                                                                                                    - DashboardFragment: An instance of the DashboardFragment is created when its class name is provided.
                                                                                                    - PurchaseFragment: An instance of the PurchaseFragment is created when its class name is provided.
                                                                                                    - SellFragment: An instance of the SellFragment is created when its class name is provided.
                                                                                                    - InventoriesFragment: An instance of the InventoriesFragment is created, and it is injected with the SuperImageController.
                                                                                                    - AnalyticsFragment: An instance of the AnalyticsFragment is created, and it is injected with the SuperImageController.
                                          - Fallback Behavior:
                                                              If the provided class name doesn't match any of the predefined fragment types, the instantiate method calls the super.instantiate method to use the default 
                                                              fragment instantiation behavior provided by the Android framework.
                                          this custom FragmentFactory is responsible for creating specific fragment instances based on their class names. It provides flexibility and customization for fragment instantiation
                                          and allows the injection of dependencies into fragments that require them. This is a useful approach for managing the creation of fragments in a modular and organized way within an 
                                          Android application.
